                <h1>A Little About Me</h1>
                <p> I was born  and raised in Oklahoma, but when I enlisted in the army I got stationed in Alaska and have been there since 2018. 
                    I was with an airborne combat team and got to do some cool stuff, but when covid hit we were ordered to spend much of a year 
                    locked in very small rooms. To stay sane I created a schedule with all sorts of activities and eventually got really into programming, 
                    and it has stuck with me since! I ended my service in February and have been working as a ski instructor and glacier/wildlife conservation 
                    guide while waiting to take on a course like this. Although my background may make me seem to be a bit of a meat head, I spend quite a bit of
                     my freetime PC gaming, obsessing over to many different fandoms, and nerding out over different  scientific topics. Feel free to reach out 
                    if you want to get to know me better!</p>

                <h1>What I'm Working On</h1>
                <p>I am currently attending Coding Temple’s 10 Week Live Full Stack Development Course that provides a thorough primer on all of the tools and 
                    technologies required to envision, design, build, test, and deploy completely functional web applications. The Python language is rapidly growing in popularity, being employed in 
                    web applications like YouTube, Reddit, DropBox, Survey Monkey, and Quora. Paired with the Django framework, it’s reliable, powerful, and fun to 
                    learn technology. The average day will consist of homework review, classroom discussions, lectures, technical quizzes, and programming exercises. 
                    Some of the concepts discussed include HTTP, Databases, Libraries, Frameworks, DRY Code, Pair Programming, and Design Patterns.</p>
